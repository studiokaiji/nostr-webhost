## 🌐 Overview

Nostr Webhost (hostr) is a command-line tool designed for hosting Single Page Applications (SPAs) using the Nostr protocol and its distributed network of relay servers. This tool provides a seamless way to deploy and access your SPA on the Nostr network.

## ⚠️ Caution
Domain-based authorization mechanisms such as NIP-7 should not currently be used. This is because the event is identified based on the path, so it will authorize other events as well.

1. `go install github.com/studiokaiji/nostr-webhost/hostr@latest`
